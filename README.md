# Search Result Card Component

A card component that can be used to display search results; for example on an online travel agency search results page.

To build this component, I used Vue.js and Tailwind CSS. I used Cypress for component testing. The component is responsive and can be viewed on different screen sizes, down to a minimum width of 300px.

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

### Run Component Tests with [Cypress Component Testing](https://on.cypress.io/component)

```sh
npm run test:unit:dev
```
